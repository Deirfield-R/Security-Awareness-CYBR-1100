Does this graphic convey a compelling story of data breaches?- Yes, I think this graphic does a really good job or comparing the severity of the leaks and how recent they are. They also give story previews and the full story when you click on it, which I think is really cool as well. 

Summary:
Definitions I learned and table (with the help of SAGE)
[CYBR1100_Week1_Terms_RoannaD.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22084836/CYBR1100_Week1_Terms_RoannaD.pdf)
I learned alot from the NetAcad where it talked about what could be be hacked into, the types of hackers(White Hat, Black Hat and Gray Hat) and how easy it is for some people to do, even on accident. I also learned a lot about Cyberterroismn and different types of cyberthreats. The netacad also taught me a bit about tools like Packettracer and how easy some of the tools are to use. Norma also taught us about password cracking and Hashcat, Cyberchef, and another tool to use, but i forgot. My personal experiences that would be influenced by these terms could just be keeping myself safe online and hopefully using these tool i learn in these classes to help keep other people safe online as well. I am hoping to go into cybersecurity to help people and prevent hackers from getting peopole's information and ruining their lives.
